		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		<p>
		For this project, we tried to create a game of pong that can both be used on a single computer and via web server. We did this by using a server at the University of St. Thomas, nodejs
    , and phaser api. Using these we were able to make 3 different types of game play. 
    Type 1: Pong with blocks. This type encourages user to try to destory the most amount of blocks possible. This is also the one that is on the score board. 
    Type 2: Multiplayer pong. This allows people on a single computer to play against a person in real life.
    Type 3: Time Challenge pong. This is a single player game of pong against a wall. The goal is to get the longest time.</p>
